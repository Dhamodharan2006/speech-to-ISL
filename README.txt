📌 Speech-to-Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator
🚀 An AI-powered tool that converts spoken language into Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

🔹 Overview
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community by translating spoken words into ISL gesture videos.

The system follows these key steps:
1️⃣ Speech Recognition – Converts spoken input into text.
2️⃣ Text Processing & NLP – Cleans, tokenizes, and processes the text.
3️⃣ Sign Gesture Mapping – Matches words with corresponding ISL videos.
4️⃣ Video Generation – Plays/merges the ISL gesture video clips.

🔹 Features
✅ Converts real-time speech into Indian Sign Language
✅ Handles text preprocessing using NLP techniques
✅ Supports Google Translate API for multilingual input
✅ Dynamically fetches ISL gesture videos for output
✅ Works for word-based and letter-based translations

🔹 Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language
Google Speech Recognition – Converts speech to text
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) – Text preprocessing & POS tagging
Google Translate API – Handles multi-language support
MoviePy – Merges and plays ISL gesture video clips
